# Smart-Recipe-Generator
Creating a complete Smart Recipe Generator application involves multiple components, including front-end and back-end development, as well as integration with an image recognition API. Below is a simplified version of the application using React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. This example will focus on the core functionalities, and you can expand upon it as needed.
Project Plan for Smart Recipe Generator
Overview
The Smart Recipe Generator is an application designed to help users create recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. By utilizing image recognition for ingredient identification and a robust recipe database, the application will cater to various dietary preferences and provide a user-friendly experience.
